Mitchell Blyth is a joint student in the Bachelor of Philosophy (Honours) degree in the Computer Aided Chemical Design Research and the Biomolecular Simulation and DynamicsÂ research groups. Mitchell has previous experience in molecular dynamics, where he investigated the behaviour of the bacterial multidrug transporter (MtrD) and a mammalian neurotransmitter transporter (GlyT2) to further understanding of the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases and chronic pain, respectively.

Currently in his Honours year, he is undertaking a multi-scale computational approach using both molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics to design and develop cheap and robust bio-inspired catalysts that capitalise upon recent research into electrostatic catalysis of non-redox reactions.
