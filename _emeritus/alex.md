Alex completed her Bachelor of Science, majoring in Biophysics, at the University of Queensland (UQ) in 2014. She stayed at UQ for Honours, where she studied a project at the interface of computational chemistry and structural biology. She achieved first class Honours in 2015 and was awarded the UQ Biochemistry Alumni Prize 3 2015. She then moved to Canberra and worked as a research assistant in the Oâ€™Mara Group at the Australian National University's Research School of Chemistry in late-2015, before commencing her PhD in this group in January 2016. Her PhD is centred on understanding how the composition of a lipid bilayer affects its behaviour, and how certain proteins interact with it. She is financially supported by scholarships from the ANU and the Westpac Bicentennial Foundation. Alex is also a 2018 Executive Director of the ANU student organisation, Fifty50.
