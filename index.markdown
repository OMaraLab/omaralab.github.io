Our research group of computational chemists is based in the Research School of Chemistry, ANU. Our research spans the disciplines of computational chemistry, computational structural biology, biological chemistry and biophysics. We use computational techniques and simulations to understand the dynamic physical and chemical properties of the molecules underpinning the function of living cells.
