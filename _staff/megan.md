Megan was awarded her PhD from the Australian National University in 2005, after completing undergraduate degrees majoring in biochemistry (University of Canberra) and physics (ANU). She accepted a Canadian Institutes of Health Research Postdoctoral Fellowship to work at the University of Calgary from 2005 to 2008, before returning to Australia in 2009 as University of Queensland Postdoctoral Fellow (2009-2011) in the School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences. In she took up an ARC DECRA at the University of Queensland and held a joint appointment as Lecturer between the School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences and the School of Mathematics and Physics. Megan joined the Research School of Chemistry as Rita Cornforth Fellow and Senior Lecturer in early 2015.  Megan’s research focuses on understanding the physical and chemical properties that govern membrane and protein function.
