Dr Katie Wilson was awarded the Young Australian Biophysicist Award at the 2020 Australian Society for Biophysics annual meeting. In 1995, the Society instituted an award for young investigators: the Young Biophysicist Award (YBA). Its purpose is to encourage members of the Society who were about to or had recently embarked on a career in biophysics, but there are no age restrictions. The award carries a cash prize of $500.
